# RIGHT JOIN

A **RIGHT JOIN** returns all rows from the **right table** (`payments`), and the matched rows from the **left table** (`customers`).
If there is no match, the result shows **NULLs** for the left-side columns.

## ‚ùì Practice Questions


1. All Payments with Customer Info

```sql
SELECT p.payment_id, p.amount, c.first_name, c.city
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
```

‚úÖ Shows every payment. Anonymous payments appear with `NULL` customer details.

---

2. Anonymous Payments

```sql
SELECT p.payment_id, p.amount
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;
```

‚úÖ Filters out payments that have no linked customer.

---

3. Replace NULL Names

```sql
SELECT p.payment_id, 
       ISNULL(c.first_name, 'Unknown') AS customer_name, 
       p.amount
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
```

‚úÖ Anonymous payments are marked as `Unknown`.

---

4. High Value Payments

```sql
SELECT p.payment_id, p.amount, c.first_name
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.amount > 2000;
```

‚úÖ Includes both known and anonymous payers.

---

5. Count Anonymous Payments

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS anonymous_count
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;
```

‚úÖ Counts how many anonymous transactions exist.

## üí° Tips

* `RIGHT JOIN` is just the reverse of `LEFT JOIN`.
* Use it mainly when you want to keep **all rows of the right-hand table**.
* Great for checking if payments exist without customer info.
