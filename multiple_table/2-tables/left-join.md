# LEFT JOIN

A **LEFT JOIN** returns all rows from the **left table** (`customers`), and the matched rows from the **right table** (`payments`).
If there is no match, the result shows **NULLs** for the right-side columns.

## üìä Example Schema

We use the same data:

### `customers`

| customer\_id | first\_name | last\_name | city         |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1            | Asma        | NULL       | Colombo      |
| 2            | Dilshan     | NULL       | Matara       |
| 3            | Denuwan     | Gamage     | Jaffna       |
| 4            | Tharusha    | Akash      | Negombo      |
| 5            | Lochana     | Nadeesh    | Kurunegala   |
| 6            | Nimesh      | Alwis      | Anuradhapura |

### `payments`

| payment\_id | customer\_id | payment\_date | amount  |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| 201         | 1            | 2025-07-01    | 2500.00 |
| 202         | 1            | 2025-07-15    | 1800.00 |
| 203         | 2            | 2025-07-20    | 950.00  |

## ‚ùì Practice Questions

### ‚úÖ With Answers

1. All Customers with Payments

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.city, p.payment_id, p.amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
```

‚úÖ Customers without payments appear with `NULL` in payment columns.

---

2. Customers Without Payments

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.city
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.payment_id IS NULL;
```

‚úÖ Filters only those who have not made payments.

---

3. Replace NULL Amounts

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, ISNULL(p.amount, 0) AS payment_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
```

‚úÖ Uses `ISNULL` (SQL Server) to show `0` instead of `NULL`.

---

4. Total Payments per Customer

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, SUM(ISNULL(p.amount, 0)) AS total_paid
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.first_name;
```

‚úÖ Includes customers with 0 total.

---

5. Jaffna/Negombo Customers

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.city, p.amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN payments p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE c.city IN ('Jaffna', 'Negombo');
```

‚úÖ Shows city residents, even if no payments.

## üí° Tips

* Use `LEFT JOIN` to find **who didn‚Äôt pay**.
* Always check `p.payment_id IS NULL` to find unmatched rows.
* Functions like `ISNULL` or `COALESCE` help replace `NULL` values.
