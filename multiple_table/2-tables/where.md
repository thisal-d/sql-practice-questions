After producing a Cartesian product, we usually add a **`WHERE` clause** to filter rows and create meaningful relationships between tables.
This is the foundation of **joining tables**.

## ‚ùì Practice Questions

### ‚úÖ With Answers

   FROM customers c, payments p
   WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
   ```

---

2. Display each payment along with the **customer‚Äôs first name and city**.

   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.city, p.payment_date, p.amount
   FROM customers c, payments p
   WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
   ```

---

3. Find all **payments greater than 2000** with customer details.

   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.city, p.payment_id, p.amount
   FROM customers c, payments p
   WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id
     AND p.amount > 2000;
   ```
