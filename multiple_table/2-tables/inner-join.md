# INNER JOIN

An **INNER JOIN** returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
This is the most common type of join.

## üí° Tips

* Always specify the join condition using `ON`.
* `INNER JOIN` filters out unmatched rows automatically (unlike `LEFT JOIN`).
* Use `WHERE` after the join for extra conditions (e.g., filtering by city or amount).
