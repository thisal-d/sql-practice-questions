## Common Mistakes & Explanations

| Mistake                                              | Explanation                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forgetting `GROUP BY` when aggregating by department | When summing per department, you must use `GROUP BY department`. |
| Using `SUM()` on non-numeric columns                 | `SUM()` only works on numeric columns like `salary`.             |
| Forgetting to filter with `WHERE` before aggregation | `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation happens.                 |

Practice summing numeric values to understand how aggregate functions help with data analysis!
